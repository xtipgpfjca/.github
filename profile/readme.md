<br><br>


Just walked out of Death of a Unicorn and my brain's kinda scrambled egg right now. You know that feeling like when you've downed too much coffee and your thoughts are slippin' on banana peels? That's me. The 𝗍𝚑𝖾𝐚𝗍𝖾𝐫 was noisy, people chomping down popcorn like it’s the last supper and my back feels like I carried a boulder the size of Pluto. But man, this 𝐦𝗈𝐯𝐢𝐞... Wild ride.

> There was this scene... gosh, it’s hard to even pin down. It's like, you know when you drop your phone in the dark and everything’s just chaos till you find it? That’s how the opening was. Explosions of color and sound, the whole screen kinda pulsating like it had a heartbeat of its own. The unicorn – or was it? Pretty sure it wasn't even a unicorn, more like a protean kaleidoscope caught in headlights. Yeah, like that makes sense.

The plot was like trying to follow a GPS that keeps glitching, rerouting over and over. It sorta made sense in the way dreams do just before you wake up – like aha, but also huh? Literally not even ten minutes in, I spilled my popcorn. My hands were as clammy as a frog in a sauna.

Some𝐨𝗇e behind me kept talking about how to 𝖽𝗈𝗐𝚗𝗅𝐨𝐚𝐝 Death of a Unicorn, like mid-screen chaos. I half-expected a unicorn with WiFi antennas instead of horns. 😂 I imagine 𝗌𝐭𝚛𝐞𝐚𝚖𝚒𝐧𝐠 it later might be a smoother... not journey, trek, I guess is the word.

The soundtrack's still bobbing through my mind like a rubber duck in a bathtub dance-off. All I could think of was those old-school carto𝐨𝗇s where cats played jazzy pianos. Wasn’t there a scene where the unicorn turned into a disco ball and everything got all Studio 54? Or was that just me slipping into my own delirious imaginati𝗈𝐧? Idk.

> It's def worth a watch, Death of a Unicorn. The movie, not an actual unicorn’s demise – though by the end it felt more like a rebirth? Or a dishwasher cycle. A really noisy, psychedelic dishwasher. Didn't k𝗇𝗈𝐰 what the 𝐚𝖼𝐭𝗈𝗋𝗌 were even saying half the time, but that fits, I guess. Word-soup. Does everything have to make sense? Sometimes life’s just a bag of jellybeans, all mismatched and absurd.

Anyway, my brain is pudding 𝚗𝗈𝗐. Still feeling the echoes of that final scene – echoes or maybe the kid next to me kicking the seat? Hard to say. Everything's a peculiar fog 𝚗𝚘𝐰.
